# Garden Buddy Data Privacy Policy

## Data that Garden Buddy uses
Garden Buddy collects the following data:
* Alexa device location
* Plant information

Garden Buddy is an Alexa hosted skill. This means that all other personal information including payment information is stored by Amazon and Garden Buddy does not have access to it.

## Alexa Device Location
The location of the device is used only to determine the user's time zone. The time zone is included in plant information to determine the exact time that watering events occur. Other than the user's time zone, no other location data will ever be shared or stored by Garden Buddy.

## Plant information
Plant information includes the names of your plants and the dates that you water them. Every time you add a plant to Garden Buddy or tell Garden Buddy that you watered a plant you are supplying plant information. Plant information **does** include time zone.

## Information we use and share
Garden Buddy reserves the right to view and share the user's plant information. The intent of collecting plant information is to gather watering statistics for different species of plants. Garden Buddy will **always** keep plant information anonymous, meaning there will be no way of associating plant information with a specific user.
